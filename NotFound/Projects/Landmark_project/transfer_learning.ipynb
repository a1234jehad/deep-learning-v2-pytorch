    "\n",
    "1. Choosing ResNet-50 as the Base Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning: ResNet-50 is a deep residual network known for its ability to learn effectively even with many layers. It addresses the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for deeper architectures without performance degradation. This makes it suitable for complex image classification tasks like landmark classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting the Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "-Batch Size (64): A moderate batch size helps balance the training speed and the stability of the learning process. A batch size of 64 is a common choice that provides a good compromise between training speed and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Validation Size (20%): Reserving 20% of the training data for validation is a standard practice. It helps in monitoring and preventing overfitting during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Number of Epochs (100): A higher number of epochs allows the model more opportunities to learn from the entire dataset. However, it's important to monitor for overfitting and use techniques like early stopping if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Number of Classes (50): This is determined by the specific problem requirement and indicates the model needs to classify images into 50 different landmark categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Learning Rate (0.001): This is a typical learning rate for Adam. It's neither too small (which would slow down convergence) nor too large (which could cause overshooting of minima).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Optimizer (Adam): Adam optimizer is often preferred for its adaptive learning rate properties, making it effective for datasets with varied features and scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Weight Decay (1e-7): A small amount of weight decay can help regularize the model and prevent overfitting, although the value here is quite small, which suggests the emphasis is on learning complex patterns rather than regularization."
